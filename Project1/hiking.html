        <p>The northern lights above Glacier National Park is a quite rare event, but when the skies here get illuminated by a celestial light show, it's absolutely memorable. Anyone who has a chance to relish aurora borealis in Glacier gets instantly enthralled. Being an eyewitness to such a display of exceptional beauty isn't something that can be soon forgotten. </p>
        <p>In Glacier National Park, you can observe polar lights at any time of the year. However, the longer nights of late fall, winter, and early spring offer the best chances to watch an unbelievable light show. The peak times are from around an hour before midnight to around an hour after. Cloudless and dark nights are the best.</p>
